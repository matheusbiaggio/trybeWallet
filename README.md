## ðŸ“’ Introduction

The project is based on a simulation of a digital wallet, in which the user can fill in a form with all his expenses in different currencies. At the end, a table shows the history of all expenses with the final amount in Brazilian Real.

The project contains the following screens: 

- `Login`
- `Main page`

At first it contains a login screen for possible verification of a DB to be created.

After validating the login, the user is redirected to the main page. The main page is a prototype of a digital wallet, wich contains a header, a form and a table.

In the header there is the registered email, which is captured via login, the project title and the total expenses present in the wallet.

The form contains some text and dropdown inputs. This form will be responsible for implementing the table.

The table informs the history of the form filled in with the final value of the conversion of the selected currency to the Brazilian Real.
